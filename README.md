# TitleDB-Legacy

This repository is the depricated, original version of the TitleDB API.

The active TitleDB WSGI code is located [over here](http://github.com/ksanislo/TitleDB).

Consider this repository to be an example of how not to design a web project. It was poorly planned, and the implementation was even worse. It continues to exist only as a reference on some of the early inner workings of the .cia scanner.
